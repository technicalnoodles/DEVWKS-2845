# Upload the Lambda Function

To upload our Lambda function we first need to package our code into a zip file. After we have packaged it properly, we may then upload the code.

## Zip Process

To zip up files, we need to go into the **CLI** and navigate to the `package` directory. Then we will create a zip file within it. The commands are as follows:

```
cd package
zip -r ../shutdownPort.zip .
```

After we have created this zip file we need to add our `lambda_function.py` file to the zip archive. This involves going up one directory and adding the file to the zip archive. The commands to do so are below:

```
cd ..
zip shutdownPort.zip lambda_function.py
```

## Upload to Lambda

Back on the AWS Lambda page underneath the **Function overview**, make sure the **Code** tab is selected. Then look to the right and there should be an **Upload from** button. Select this button and then select `.zip file`. It should look similar to this image:

After selecting the `.zip` option, it will bring up an `Upload` diaglog box. Upload the `shutdownPort.zip` file using this diaglog box.

It will take a few minutes to unpack the file, but once it finishes you should see your completed file in the code editor like the below image:

Now that the code is uploaded we need to deploy it. Click on the **Deploy** button and wait for it to finish. We can now move onto creating the API Gateway.
