# Create the Lambda Function

After the Lambda page is open, we can create a new function. Click on the **Create a Function** button on the right side of the screen to start the creation process.

After the **Create a function** has loaded, we want to fill in some fields. We want this function to be authored from scratch using the `Author from scratch` option.  
The input field `Function name` should have a value of `shutdownPort`. You may use another name if you would prefer, but this lab will use shutdownPort.
The dropdown for the `Runtime` should be set to `Python 3.8`.  
The last option called `Architecture` (besides the advanced options) will need to be set to `x86_64`.

After all these fields have been set, the function should look similar to the below image:

Finally, we can click on **_Create function_** on the bottom right of the page to create our Lambda function.
