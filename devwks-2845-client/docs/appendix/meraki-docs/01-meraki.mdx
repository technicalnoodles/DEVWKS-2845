# Create & Save Meraki API key and Network ID

In this section, we will go through the process of obtaining a Meraki API key and Organization ID.

First we need to sign in to the Meraki dashboard using [dashboard.meraki.com](https://dashboard.meraki.com).

It should take you to a login page for the Meraki Dashboard. Please sign in using the credentials provided to you. If asked for an Organization to log into, please choose the `CiscoLive` organization.

After getting logged in, we need to generate an API key.

## Create Meraki API Key

Go to the top right where it has your username and select it. A drop down should show up and then select `My Profile`. It should look similar to what is below:  
![profile](../../img/meraki/select-profile.png)

After your profile loads, scroll down to the **API access** section. Then click on `Generate new API key`.

It will bring up a popup that has your API key like in the below image:
![api key](../../img/meraki/generate-api-key.png)

Copy the API key and store it in a file locally. Then check the `I have stored my new API key` box and click on done.

## Get the Network ID

On the left side of the page please hover over `Network` and select the trainee network that is the same as your login ID.

It should look similar to what is below:

`Network` -> `traineeX`.

![network switching](../../img/meraki/net-switch.jpg)

It should look like the above where the **X** is the number of your trainee login.

Select `Systems Manager` then `General` and scroll to the bottom. In the `SecureX` section, you should see the **_Network ID_**. Make a copy of this.

:::note

**_Alternatively_** if you are doing this in the future, you can get the Network ID a different way using the Meraki Dashboard API

Go to the [Meraki Developer](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-latest/) documentation. Once here, please search for `Get Organization Networks` in the search bar on the left. It should load the API page for that call. Now click on the `Configuration` button on the right side. Replace the `APIKey in header` field with the one you generated earlier. The rest can be left alone, click `Save`.

Still on the right side, please enter the Organization ID we obtained earlier in the `Organization Id` box. Then click on `Run`. It will return the networks associated with your account. Near the bottom, your network should show up. It will be named after your username. Please save the `id` field.

Now we can start working with the Meraki API and a create a custom webhook.
