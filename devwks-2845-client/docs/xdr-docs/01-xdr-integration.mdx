# Creating a Workflow

When creating a workflow without using the built in Meraki integraiton, we first need to be able to store the API key in a secure way within XDR, then we can use it in the workflow.

## Create a Secure Workflow Variable

1. After logging into XDR, go to **Automate -> Variables**

![variables](./img/variables.png)

2. Then click on the **+ Nwew Variable** button on the right side to create a new variables

![variables](./img/new-variable.png)

3. In the fields of the new variable change them as follows:

- **Data Type** -> _Secure String_
- **Display Name** -> _[stationNumber]MerakiKey_
- **Scope** -> Environment
- **Value** -> meraki api key from earlier

It should look siilar to the below:
