# Use Webhook Data

1. Go to back to the workflow that was created earlier and open it to be edited.

2. You will notice that the **Workflow is locked**, click on the text for it and click on **Unlck and edit**.

3. Click on the **JSONPath Query**

4. Remove all the JSON from the **Source JSON to Query** field.

5. Click on the selector button and go to **Rule -> Webhook rule -> Output -> Request Body**

6. Click **Save**

7. Now we need to validate the workflow again, by clicking on **Validate** on the top right.

This concludes making the workflow and getting it the data it needs.
